Development of a mobile app at a 3 day hackaton "Hacker Games Kaunas 2017"â€‹. Mobile app helps users to find public access points by scanning them and publishing to internet for other app users to see them on a map. App collects access points even when internet access is not available and pushes them any time it connects to the internet. Each wifi access point is displayed on a map with a color: red meaning private and green as public. Clicking on a access point displays it's SSID and date when this access point was last detected as active. Application is powered by community, more users using this app, more access points are detected and refreshed on the map. App was published to Google Play Store and presented at the pitching of a hackaton.
